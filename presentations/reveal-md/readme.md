## TLDR

```bash
$ npm install reveal-md
$ make # build it in docs
$ make watch # live releoad

```

## Fonts

You want to have Myriad Pro,  Myriad Pro Light and  Myriad Pro Light Italic to
be installed for it to look great.  Helvetical Neue and [PT
Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans?selection.family=PT+Sans) Might
be a good alternative available as webfonts.
